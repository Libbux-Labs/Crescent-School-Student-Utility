        <p>The <a href="http://studentutility.crescentschool.org">Crescent School Student Utility</a> is a mobile (<a href="">iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone, HP WebOS, and Symbian) application for <a href="http://www.crescentschool.org">Crescent School</a> students which is designed, developed, and maintained by Crescent students. We built it to make our lives easier when we're trying to access information which we use every day. <i>From students, for students.</i>
